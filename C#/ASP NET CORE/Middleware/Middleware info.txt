General:
A piece of middleware is a delegate that does a specific task. 
Middleware forms what is called the "pipeline" which handles web requests and responses.

Structure:
Generally, nuget packages will have their own extension methods to call on IApplicationBuilder when configuring the middleware. 
However you may want to write your own custom middleware. The structure is as follows:

1) Code that operates on the request
2) A delegate, conventionally named "next", which when invoked, runs the next piece of middleware.
3) Code that operates on the response.
See Structure.cs for an example.

Run vs Use:
You have have noticed too methods when writing your own middleware. App.Use, and App.Run. 

What's the difference?
The difference is simple; App.Use takes the "next" delegate, and App.Run does not.

What does that mean?
All that means, is that the you cannot call subsequent middleware from App.Run.
See Run vs Use.cs for an example.

Why would I use app.Run, then?
You would use app.Run when it is the last piece of middleware and you have no need for a "next" delegate.

Multiple pipelines:
You might wonder, what if I want to configure different pipelines?
IApplicationBuilder has a method, Map, to help us here. You can define custom routes to map different pipelines to.
See Map.cs for an example.
